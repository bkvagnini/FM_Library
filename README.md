# FM_Library
New FM Library Database to find CDs
(design considerations)

As of 3/16/10

Spoke with: Joe, TC, Taylor, Dan, Mark, Rob, Ken, and Thom
Active Users: Joe, Dan, Taylor, TC

Wishlist:
Make it so that value can be the same for all of the songs (e.g. same composer/performer for the entire disc, to save time)
Allow partial name searches (e.g. an * when looking for “An American in Paris”)

Phase II: pull as much as possible from the Internet databases that the CD ripping software uses

Fields:

Genre (get list of these-  try to generate in PHP/HTML vs. doing a separate table)

Format (CD, Album, Reel to Reel etc. - get accurate list)

Multidisc?
